# pokedexcli

## Welcome
Welcome to the Pokedex CLI repository! Here, we're building a command-line REPL tool that fetches information about Pokemon from the PokÃ©API.

If you're unfamiliar with Pokemon or a Pokedex, don't fret! A Pokedex is simply a fictional device from the Pokemon universe used to gather insights about these fascinating creatures, like their types, names, and stats.

## What Are We Constructing?
- A command-line REPL tool (Pokedex).
- Integration with the [PokÃ©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokemon data.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, you'll learn about:
- **Go's JSON Parsing**: Understand the syntax and effectively parse JSON data in Go.
- **HTTP Requests in Go**: Send and handle HTTP requests using Go's standard libraries.
- **CLI Development**: Create an interactive CLI tool that interfaces with a backend server.
- **Local Go Development**: Get hands-on experience with local Go development practices and tooling.
- **Performance Enhancement**: Understand and implement caching mechanisms to boost performance and reduce redundant API calls.
Enjoy exploring the Pokemon universe with our Pokedex CLI! ðŸš€
