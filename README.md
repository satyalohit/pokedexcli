# pokedexcli

WELCOME
WHAT ARE WE CONSTRUCTING?
In a command-line REPL, we'll create a Pokedex. All of the data we require will be powered by the Pok√©API.
It's acceptable if you've never heard of Pokemon or a Pokedex. 
A Pokedex is merely a fictional tool that enables us to seek up information about Pokemon, like their type, name, and stats.
